     <p><b>Traveling in Depression</b><br><br>
   When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought <br> me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has<br> given me a unique learning experience.

  <p> At five, I

  at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the <br>heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways <br>on sleek gondolas. 
  At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of

<p> It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first <br>became interested in language.</p>
  <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of<br> pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris <br>where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it <br>PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on<br> the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
  
 <p> In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and<br> aware of its similarities with English through cognates.<br> Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks <br>different but sounds nearly the same.This was incredible to<br> me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.<a href="mailto:gbadiwuc438@gmail.com">Send Us Email</a></p>
  
  Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character,the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ(火) meaning fire and Shān(山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān(火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</dd>
